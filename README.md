## Development setup

1. Clone repository and install dependencies

   ```
   git clone git@github.com:satoshilabs/password-manager.git
   cd password-manager
   npm install
   ```

2. Set Chrome/Chromium to [Developer Mode](https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked)

3. For setup [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps/create)
   and [Google Drive](https://console.developers.google.com/apis/),
   you need to register and obtain own API keys.
   - Dropbox API key is located in file `/source/background/classes/dropbox_mgmt.js`
     [view on github](https://github.com/satoshilabs/password-manager/blob/master/source/background/classes/dropbox_mgmt.js#L11)
   - Google Drive needs to set OAuth.client_id in `/extension/manifest.json` [view on github](https://github.com/satoshilabs/password-manager/blob/master/extension/manifest.json#L49)
4. To make your dev version of extension accessible for TREZOR Chrome Extension and TREZOR Bridge
   you need to append key value into your extension manifest file. It will override dev extension id to same id as original TREZOR Password manager.
   **Remove this key before releasing to production and inform our support to add your new extension key into whitelist!**
   [Read about Manifest key](https://developer.chrome.com/apps/manifest/key)

   ```
   "key": "MIIBIjANBgkqhkiG9w0BAQEFAAOCAQ8AMIIBCgKCAQEAgRzyy+IKeaKZA6SIHgrDSinXRNcNq1tT/WeyX1K6gTnVc8KFRVHu5CLf0xN0eCfuz7JKy7U+XfNBzO2i0pkamma6kFMEpvX73WU3Lvmc+g6jg/VSZc9OOgCocT6I8FX92ad1Mj6qcDjVyCkpE2FPotUkuH0PwqQNzSQjPor+KhNPnOQIf5IqLvFEr7P4hUTgyiTUsOX6ROxk61EvP1Fi+Qllscgkm961q+/puw+9Z0Gr4eNIgfAK7DpYj0UJQsdlBP59PQqbW91mwPrKTr3FHmaHGOk+odLCOgchN8MmXgLpqoar1Rxo/AXs5BdnyCprlVHvtXRYbLlthQVzxYylNwIDAQAB",
